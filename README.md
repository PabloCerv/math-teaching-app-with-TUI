<h2>Project summary</h2>
<p align="justify">As part of the professional practice program that bears the name of: <i>"Sistemas y ambientes educativos"</i> (<i>"Educational systems and environments"</i>), it was requested to generate a desktop application for elementary students about mathematics assessments with which they will interact by using a  tangible user interface (<i>smart mat</i>) already provided, with The following requirements:</p>
<p align="justify">
<ul>
        <li>The student must interact with the <i>TUI</i> to solve the exercises shown in the application.
        <li>The communication between the <i>TUI</i> and the application must be via a Bluetooth connection.
        <li>The exercises that will be shown to the student must be adapted to interact with the <i>TUI</i> through the classic <i>game of the plane</i>.
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p align="justify">The overall objective of the project is:</p>
<p align="justify">
<ul>
        <li>Develop a desktop application that shows elementary level math exercises with which you can interact using a <i>TUI</i> with the use of bluetooth technology.
</ul>
</p>
<p align="justify">The specific objectives that will lead to fulfill the general are:</p>
<p align="justify">
<ul>
        <li>Identify the viability of the different development IDE that allow easy communication with bluetooth devices in order to ensure the completion of the project in the estimated time.
        <li>Build the exercises and activities that will be displayed within the application in order to ensure optimal interaction with the <i>TUI</i>.
        <li>Develop the application using an agile model to conclude the product based on the time and requirements provided.
        <li>Validate the application system with the specification of the necessary tests that demonstrate its correct operation in order to release the product with the best possible software quality.
</ul>
